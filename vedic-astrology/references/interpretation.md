## Graha in Bhava (planet in house)

For *what a specific planet does in a specific house*, run **`houses.py`** — its
bhava report now prints a concise traditional reading for every planet occupying
a house (a `→ Planet: …` line in text, `occupant_readings` in `--json`), for all
nine grahas across the twelve houses. Tune each reading by the planet's **dignity**
(exalted/own strengthens it; debilitated/combust strains it), the **aspects** on
the house, and the **house lord's** placement — `houses.py` reports all four.

A house with no occupant is read through its **lord's** placement and the planets
**aspecting** it, not skipped.

## A simple reading order

1. **Lagna (1st house) & its lord** — overall constitution and life direction.
2. **Moon sign & nakshatra** — the emotional mind; the basis of dasha timing.
   See `nakshatras.md` for the Moon-nakshatra personality notes.
3. **Sun sign** — soul, vitality, the "Vedic sun-sign."
4. **Planet dignities** — exalted/own = strong; debilitated = challenged.
5. **House occupancy** — which planets sit in which bhavas, and what that means
   (run `houses.py` for the Graha-in-Bhava readings).
6. **Yogas** — notable combinations (see `yogas.md`).
7. **Current dasha** — which planetary period is active now (run `dasha.py` and,
   as a cross-check, the Yogini cycle via `dasha_yogini.py`).
8. **Strength** — confirm with the six-fold Shadbala + Ashtakavarga (`strength.py`).

## Dasha interpretation

A planet's Mahadasha colors that whole period with its significations; the running
Antardasha (sub-period) modifies it. E.g. a Jupiter–Venus period blends growth/
wisdom (Jupiter) with relationships/comfort (Venus). Keep it descriptive and
non-deterministic.
