dasha_predict.py — Interpret the *currently running* Vimshottari dasha.

Where dasha.py answers "WHICH period am I in?", this script answers "WHAT does
that period mean for me?" — across daily life, mind, career, money,
relationships, health, family, enemies, education, and spirituality.

It is chart-aware, not generic. The reading layers three things:

  1. The dasha lord's intrinsic significations (karaka) per life area.
  2. WHERE that lord sits and WHAT it rules in *this* birth chart (house
     placement + house lordship from the Lagna).
  3. The lord's dignity (exalted / own / debilitated / combust) and the
     Maha-lord ↔ Antar-lord natural relationship (friend / neutral / enemy),
     which colours how smoothly the results flow.

Usage:
    python dasha_predict.py --date 1983-12-29 --time 18:30:00 \\
        --lat 26.9196 --lon 75.7878 --tz Asia/Kolkata \\
        [--on 2026-06-04] [--ayanamsa lahiri] [--json]

--on  the date to interpret for (default: today). The script locates the
      Mahadasha / Antardasha / Pratyantardasha active on that date.

PLANET_EFFECTS = {
    "Sun": {
        "daily": "Visibility and authority rise; days revolve around status, leadership, and asserting your will. Ego and pride run hot.",
        "mind": "Confident, willful, decisive — but can turn proud, rigid, or domineering when challenged.",
        "career": "A status / promotion phase: dealings with government, bosses, and leadership roles. Favours stepping into authority, administration, politics, or medicine.",
        "money": "Income flows through position, recognition, government, or the father rather than through trade. Earnings are visible but not naturally a saving period.",
        "relationships": "Bonds are tested by ego and dominance. Father and authority figures loom large; manage pride to avoid strain with the spouse.",
        "health": "Watch the heart, eyes, bones, blood pressure, and fevers/head. Vitality is generally strong but overwork drains it.",
        "family": "The father — or your own paternal role and standing in the family — is in focus. Clashes over authority are possible.",
        "enemies": "You overcome rivals through sheer authority and willpower; but arrogance can create fresh opponents. Friction with officials if the Sun is afflicted.",
        "education": "Favours leadership, administration, politics, and medicine; recognition for past learning.",
        "spirituality": "Soul-searching and devotion to the higher Self; Sun/Shiva worship and pilgrimage. Fortune comes through the father and dharma.",

    "Moon": {
        "daily": "Mood-led, changeable days dominated by comfort, the home, the public, and women. Restless travel and frequent shifts of plan.",
        "mind": "Emotionally sensitive, nurturing, and intuitive — but moody and prone to anxiety or overthinking when the Moon is weak.",
        "career": "Good for public-facing work — the masses, hospitality, nursing, food, liquids, real estate. Popularity and demand rise; expect frequent change.",
        "money": "Cashflow ebbs and flows like the tides. Gains via the public, mother, property, and liquids; impulsive spending is a risk.",
        "relationships": "Emotional closeness, romance, and care take centre stage. Mother and women are significant; the need for emotional security drives bonds.",
        "health": "Watch fluids, digestion, chest/lungs, blood, sleep, and above all the mind. Stress-related and emotional complaints need care.",
        "family": "Mother and home are central — domestic matters, property, moving house. Family bonds deepen or are tested emotionally.",
        "enemies": "You disarm opposition through adaptability and public goodwill rather than force; emotional reactivity can be used against you.",
        "education": "Favours the arts, psychology, and caring or public fields; learning comes through feeling and memory.",
        "spirituality": "Devotion of the heart, mother-goddess worship, water pilgrimage. Fortune flows through the public and the mother.",
    },
    "Mars": {
        "daily": "High energy, drive, and friction. Days are action-packed and competitive — sometimes anger- or accident-prone. A push to act, build, and fight.",
        "mind": "Bold, courageous, and decisive — but short-tempered, impatient, and combative under stress.",
        "career": "Energises engineering, defence/police, surgery, sports, machinery, manufacturing, and real estate. Good for bold initiative; risk of conflict with colleagues.",
        "money": "Gains through land, property, siblings, sports, or technical/competitive work. Impulsive risk-taking brings sudden gains and losses.",
        "relationships": "Passion runs high — and so does conflict. Watch for arguments, dominance, and impatience with partners (a Manglik-flavoured phase).",
        "health": "Accidents, cuts, burns, fevers, inflammation, blood, and surgery; anger-driven blood pressure. Take care with sharp objects and vehicles.",
        "family": "Focus on siblings (especially brothers), property disputes, and protecting one's own. Tempers can fracture the home.",
        "enemies": "A strong phase to defeat rivals, win disputes, and force through obstacles by courage — provided you don't make reckless new enemies.",
        "education": "Favours technical, mechanical, medical/surgical, and defence studies; learning by doing and competing.",
        "spirituality": "Energy channelled into disciplined practice (tapas) and Hanuman/Kartikeya worship — the warrior's path. Fortune through courage and effort.",
    },
    "Mercury": {
        "daily": "Mentally busy days of communication, paperwork, trade, short trips, and negotiation. Quick and versatile — scattered if Mercury is weak.",

        "money": "Earnings through trade, commission, intellect, and many small streams. A favourable phase for deals and business; speculative if afflicted.",
        "relationships": "Friendly, communicative bonds formed through study, networks, and conversation. Logic over emotion; youthful and flirtatious.",
        "health": "Watch the nervous system, skin, speech, lungs, and intestines. Stress shows as anxiety and nervous complaints.",
        "family": "Focus on relatives, friends, communication within the family, and the education of younger ones. Good for settling matters through dialogue.",
        "enemies": "You outwit opponents through cleverness, negotiation, and contracts rather than confrontation; good for winning arguments and paperwork battles.",
        "education": "One of the best phases for study, exams, and skills — especially mathematics, commerce, languages, and technology.",
        "spirituality": "Intellectual, scriptural spirituality — study of texts, mantra, and astrology; Vishnu worship. Fortune through skill and communication.",
    },
    "Jupiter": {
        "daily": "Expansive, optimistic, fortunate days centred on growth, learning, guidance, and meaningful opportunity. Generally one of the most benefic phases.",
        "mind": "Wise, calm, hopeful, and principled; faith and good judgment grow. Can tip into over-optimism or complacency.",
        "career": "Growth, promotion, mentorship — teaching, law, finance, consulting, religion. Good for expansion, new roles, and guidance from elders.",
        "money": "A strong wealth phase: gains, savings, and investments tend to rise. Money through wisdom, finance, teaching, and good counsel.",
        "relationships": "Favours marriage, commitment, and children, and deepens bonds through trust and shared values. A classic phase for weddings and childbirth.",
        "health": "Generally protective of health; watch the liver, weight gain, fat, diabetes, and overindulgence — the body tends to expand.",
        "family": "Excellent for children, gurus, elders, and family expansion. Harmony, blessings, and growth in the household.",
        "enemies": "Opponents are pacified or won over; disputes settle in your favour through wisdom, fairness, and the support of well-wishers.",
        "education": "The finest phase for higher learning, philosophy, scripture, and law; honours and degrees come.",
        "spirituality": "Deep growth in dharma, devotion, ethics, and pilgrimage; the guru's grace. The most fortunate phase for fortune (bhagya) itself.",
    },
    "Venus": {
        "daily": "Pleasant, comfort-seeking, sociable days centred on love, beauty, luxury, art, and pleasure. Generally enjoyable and harmonious.",
        "mind": "Romantic, refined, and harmony-loving; artistic — but can turn indulgent, vain, or pleasure-driven.",
        "career": "Favours arts, entertainment, fashion, beauty, luxury goods, design, hospitality, vehicles, and partnerships. Good for creative, people-facing work.",
        "money": "Often the most prosperous of all phases (Venus = 20 years of comfort). Gains through luxury, art, partnerships, and women; lavish spending too.",
        "relationships": "The strongest phase for love, romance, marriage, and sensual pleasure. Attraction and partnership flourish — a central life theme now.",
        "health": "Watch the reproductive system, kidneys, throat, and over-indulgence in sweets and comforts. Vitality is usually good and sensual.",
        "family": "Harmony, comfort, and beauty in the home; spouse and the women of the family are prominent. Good for furnishing the home and celebrations.",
        "enemies": "Conflicts dissolve through charm, diplomacy, and compromise; you win through attraction and goodwill rather than confrontation.",
        "education": "Favours the arts, music, design, management, and aesthetic or luxury fields; refined, creative learning.",
        "spirituality": "Devotion through beauty, music, and bhakti; Lakshmi worship — pleasure balanced with grace. Fortune through partners, comfort, and art.",
    },
    "Saturn": {
        "daily": "Slow, heavy, disciplined days of work, duty, delay, and endurance. Demanding but maturing — it rewards patience and punishes shortcuts.",
        "mind": "Serious, cautious, and persevering; deep and realistic — but prone to worry, fear, loneliness, or low mood when Saturn is weak.",
        "career": "Rewards sustained hard work — labour, service, mining, oil, iron, the masses, law, and long-term institutions. A slow climb; promotions come late but solid, often with heavy workload or job change.",
        "money": "Money comes slowly through labour and persistence; structure and saving are favoured, but cashflow can feel tight. Gains via service and established assets.",
        "relationships": "Tests of commitment — distance, duty over romance, age gaps, and endurance. Delays in marriage; bonds either mature or feel cold and burdened.",
        "health": "Watch bones, joints, teeth, knees, nerves, and chronic or degenerative issues, plus fatigue and low mood. Complaints are slow-healing and long-running.",
        "family": "Responsibility for elders and dependents; restriction, separation, or burden at home. Duty toward family outweighs pleasure.",
        "enemies": "Opponents are ground down by your patience rather than your speed; legal matters drag but resolve with discipline. Beware chronic feuds.",
        "education": "Favours deep, disciplined, long study — research, technical mastery, law, history; success through perseverance, often after setbacks.",
        "spirituality": "The great teacher: detachment, discipline, and service to the poor; Shani/Hanuman worship. Karmic lessons mature the soul. Fortune through patience and right action.",
    },
    "Rahu": {
        "daily": "Unconventional, ambitious, turbulent days. Sudden events, foreign matters, technology, obsession, and material craving — everything feels amplified and unpredictable.",
        "mind": "Restless and ambitious, with obsessive desires; anxiety, confusion, and fascination with the new, the foreign, or the forbidden.",
        "career": "Sudden rises (and falls), foreign links, technology, media, aviation, speculation, politics, and unconventional fields. Big ambition and shortcuts — explosive growth or scandal.",
        "money": "Sudden gains and sudden losses; speculation, foreign income, and schemes. Money can balloon or evaporate — avoid fraud and over-leverage.",
        "relationships": "Unconventional, intense, or foreign relationships; sudden attractions and possible deception. Boundaries and clarity get blurred.",
        "health": "Mysterious, hard-to-diagnose, or chronic ailments; poisoning, infections, anxiety, addictions, and phobias. Watch the unexplained.",
        "family": "Disruption, foreign separation, or unconventional situations at home; mixing with outsiders. Sudden change or estrangement is possible.",
        "enemies": "Hidden enemies, conspiracies, and underhanded tactics — yours or theirs. You can defeat rivals by cunning, but beware being deceived.",
        "education": "Favours technology, research, foreign study, and the occult or cutting-edge; obsessive deep dives.",
        "spirituality": "A pull toward the occult, foreign or unorthodox paths, and sudden awakening through crisis; Durga worship. Fortune is erratic and karmic.",

        "daily": "Detached, inward, unpredictable days. Focus turns away from the material — letting go, endings, and solitude. Things slip away or feel unreal.",
        "mind": "Detached, intuitive, and introspective; doubt and disinterest in worldly affairs, broken by flashes of insight.",
        "career": "Erratic, unsatisfying worldly results; sudden separations from work, or a pull toward research, healing, the occult, and behind-the-scenes roles. Recognition feels hollow.",
        "money": "Indifference to money; unexpected losses or detachment from gains. Not a phase for accumulation — spending drifts to the unseen or the wasteful.",
        "relationships": "Detachment, separation, or dissatisfaction; spiritual or karmic bonds. Endings, and a sense of 'this isn't enough.'",
        "health": "Mysterious ailments, misdiagnosis, viral or karmic issues, surgery, and accidents; psychosomatic, hard-to-pin-down complaints.",
        "family": "Separation, distance, or detachment from family; a sense of not belonging. Karmic completions at home.",
        "enemies": "Enemies may simply fade or self-destruct; you win by withdrawal and non-attachment rather than fighting. Hidden adversaries are possible.",
        "education": "Favours research, the occult, healing, mathematics, and mysticism; deep, solitary, intuitive study. Conventional study can feel pointless.",
        "spirituality": "The strongest phase for moksha, detachment, meditation, and liberation; Ganesha/Shiva worship. Past-life completion. Fortune is spiritual, not material.",
