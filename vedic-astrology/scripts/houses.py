houses.py — Bhava (house) report.

The kundli lists planets; this reads the chart house by house — the way a
practitioner actually answers "what about my 7th house / my career / my health".
For each of the twelve bhavas it gives the sign on the house, its lord and where
that lord sits (and in what dignity), the planets sitting in the house — each
with a concise Graha-in-Bhava reading of what that planet does there — the
planets aspecting it (Vedic graha drishti), and the natural karaka: the four
classical ways a house gets its results.

Usage:
    python houses.py --date 1990-08-15 --time 14:30:00 \\
        --lat 28.6139 --lon 77.2090 --tz Asia/Kolkata \\
