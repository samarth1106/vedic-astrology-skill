# Numerology (Ank Jyotish)

Offline numerology calculator. All math runs locally in pure Python — **only the
standard library, no ephemeris, no API keys, no network**. This module inherits
the repository's **AGPL-3.0** license.

## Required & optional inputs

| Input | Format | Required | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Date  | `YYYY-MM-DD` | **Yes** | Date of birth. Drives Moolank, Bhagyank, Lo Shu, Pinnacles. |
| Name  | `"Full Name"` | No | Enables Naamank, name trinity, Maturity, compatibility, Karmic Lessons, name-correction. |
| Year  | `YYYY` | No | Enables the personal-year theme. |
| `--on`  | `YYYY-MM-DD` | No | Personal year/month/day + universal-year cycles for that date. |
| `--date2` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | No | Second person's DOB — adds two-person (couple) compatibility. `--name2` optional. |
| `--check-number` | digit string | No | Score a mobile/house/vehicle/account number vs the core numbers (`--check-kind`). |
| `--check-name` | `"Business Name"` | No | Score a business/brand name vs the core numbers. |

Only the date is required. Everything else degrades gracefully when omitted.

## The two name-number systems

- **Chaldean** — ancient system, values 1–8 only (no letter is assigned 9).
  Reports the *compound* number first, then reduces to a single digit.
- **Pythagorean** — modern A=1…I=9, J=1…R=9, S=1…Z=8 system.

Default `--system both` reports both. The first requested system is used for the
compatibility and name-correction logic.

## Routing — running the script

One script, `scripts/numerology.py`. It prints a clean text report by default and
accepts `--json` for machine-readable output.

```bash
cd scripts

# Full report (date + name + personal year, both systems)
python3 numerology.py --date 1990-08-15 --name "Albert Einstein" \
  --system both --year 2026

# Minimal (date only)
python3 numerology.py --date 1990-08-15

# Chaldean only, keep master numbers 11/22/33 unreduced where noted
python3 numerology.py --date 2000-02-29 --system chaldean --keep-master

# Personal cycles for a specific date (universal/personal year, month, day)
python3 numerology.py --date 1990-08-15 --on 2026-06-08

# Two-person (couple) compatibility
python3 numerology.py --date 1990-08-15 --name "Person A" \
  --date2 1991-06-09 --name2 "Person B"

# Lucky-number checks (mobile / house / vehicle / account, and a business name)
python3 numerology.py --date 1990-08-15 \
  --check-number "9876543210" --check-kind mobile \
  --check-name "Acme Labs"

# JSON output for further processing
python3 numerology.py --date 1990-08-15 --name "Albert Einstein" --json
```

### Flags

- `--date YYYY-MM-DD` — **required**, date of birth.
- `--name "Full Name"` — optional; enables name-based sections.
- `--system chaldean|pythagorean|both` — default `both`.
- `--year YYYY` — optional; adds the personal-year theme.
- `--keep-master` — keep 11/22/33 unreduced in Moolank/Bhagyank/Naamank where the
  reduction would otherwise pass through a master number. Ruling-planet lookups
  still use the fully reduced single digit.
- `--on YYYY-MM-DD` — add personal year/month/day + universal-year cycles for that date.
- `--date2 YYYY-MM-DD` / `--name2` — add two-person (couple) compatibility.
- `--check-number "digits"` / `--check-kind number|mobile|house|vehicle|account` —
  score an arbitrary number against the core numbers.
- `--check-name "Business Name"` — score a business/brand name against the core numbers.
- `--json` — emit JSON instead of the formatted text report.

## Yantras — `scripts/yantra.py`

A second script generates **numeric yantras** (magic-square diagrams) as text,
JSON, and **printable SVG images**. A magic square is a grid where every row,
column, and diagonal sum to the same total. Three kinds:

```bash
cd scripts

# Personalised 4×4 birth yantra from a date of birth (+ printable SVG)
python3 yantra.py --date 1990-08-15 --svg birth_yantra.svg

# A Navagraha planetary 3×3 yantra (surya/chandra/mangal/budh/guru/
#   shukra/shani/rahu/ketu) — prints its bija mantra + best day
python3 yantra.py --planet guru --svg guru_yantra.svg

# All nine planetary yantras at once (SVG path used as a filename prefix)
python3 yantra.py --planet all --svg navagraha

# A custom 3×3 magic square for any total (must be a multiple of 3)
python3 yantra.py --target 24 --svg lucky_yantra.svg

# JSON for further processing
python3 yantra.py --planet shani --json
```

- **Birth yantra (`--date`)** — 4×4; top row is day/month/century-part/year-part,
  every line sums to their total. Occasional zero/negative cells (small birth
  months) are mathematically fine — the square stays magic.
- **Planetary yantra (`--planet`)** — 3×3; Surya = the classical Lo Shu (sum 15),
  each later graha lifts the centre by one. Includes the traditional **bija
  (seed) mantra** and best weekday.
- **Custom yantra (`--target N`)** — 3×3 for any total `N` that is a multiple of 3.
- `--svg PATH` writes a decorative SVG (gated bhupura + lotus-petal ring + grid).

**Always offer the "how to use" guidance** — many people don't know what a yantra
is for. Load `references/yantra.md` and explain: what a yantra is (a focusing
diagram, not a prediction), which one fits the user's goal, and the simple daily
practice (face east/north, set an intention, soft-gaze the centre — *trataka* —
and repeat the mantra ~108×). Be honest that it is a contemplative/cultural aid
that complements real action, never replaces medical/financial/legal help.

## What the report contains

1. **Moolank** (psychic / birth number) — reduced day of birth, with ruling planet.
2. **Bhagyank** (destiny / life-path) — reduced sum of all DOB digits, shows the chain.
3. **Naamank** (name number) — compound + reduced, per requested system.
4. **Name trinity** (with a name) — **Expression / Destiny** (all letters, natural
   talents), **Soul Urge / Antaratma** (vowels, inner cravings), **Personality**
   (consonants, outer impression), plus the **Maturity** number (Life Path + Expression).
   Y counts as a vowel only when it has no adjacent vowel in its word.
5. **Ruling planet** — Sun/Moon/Jupiter/Rahu/Mercury/Venus/Ketu/Saturn/Mars for 1–9.
6. **Compatibility** — whether the Naamank is friend/neutral/enemy to the Moolank
   and Bhagyank, using planetary friendships, with a recommendation.
7. **Karmic layer** — **Karmic Debt** numbers (13/14/16/19 appearing as a core
   compound) and **Karmic Lessons** (the 1–9 values entirely absent from the name).
8. **Lo Shu grid** — digit placement, counts, missing numbers, and detected
   arrows of strength (line fully present) and weakness (line fully absent).
9. **Pinnacles & Challenges** — four life-stage peak themes and four challenge
   lessons, each with the age range it governs (derived from the reduced DOB).
10. **Personal year** (only with `--year`) — the 1–9 theme for that year.
11. **Personal cycles** (only with `--on`) — universal year, personal year/month/day.
12. **Lucky attributes** — gemstone, days, and colors for the Moolank's ruler.
13. **Name-correction hint** — if the name conflicts with a core number, the target
    single-digit Naamank values that are friends of *both* core numbers (principle
    only — the skill does not auto-generate spellings).
14. **Number check** (only with `--check-number`) — a mobile/house/vehicle/account
    number's compound + reduced value and whether it is friendly to the core numbers.
15. **Business/name check** (only with `--check-name`) — a brand name's number vs the core.
16. **Two-person compatibility** (only with `--date2`) — friend/neutral/enemy across
    both people's core (and optional name) numbers, with a 0–100% score and verdict.

## Presenting results

1. Run the script; relay the text table directly or use `--json` and reformat.
2. **Always restate the disclaimer** — this is non-predictive, cultural content.
3. For per-number meanings (keywords, strengths, challenges, lucky attributes) and
   the master-number notes, load `references/numbers.md` on demand.
4. Be honest about scope: numerology is a traditional symbolic system, not a
   measurement of anything. Name correction gives target *numbers* and the
   underlying principle, not specific spellings.
