numerology.py — Compute a numerology report from birth date (and optional name).

Pure Python standard library only — no ephemeris, no network, no dependencies.
Covers Moolank (psychic/birth number), Bhagyank (destiny/life-path number),
Naamank (name number, Chaldean and/or Pythagorean), ruling planets, number
compatibility (planetary friendships), the Lo Shu grid with arrows, an optional
personal-year theme, lucky attributes, and a name-correction hint.
